Z-score is the key indicator here:
Z-score = 0 is historical mean of delta drift on SPY options
positive Z score is delta drifting upwards = dealers hedging via selling SPY ETF
Negative Z score is delta drifting downwards = dealers hedging via buying SPY ETF
This results in changes in SPY spot, which are not driven by fundamnetals but rather hedging necessity
Edge lays in timing the reversion to fundamnetal-pricing
